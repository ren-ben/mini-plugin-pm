<b>Project PM </b> is a Private Messaging system Test Plugin

# Description👀

This is a test plugin, meaning I don't really intend it for the public use, the "Mini Plugin" series is for me to play around in both Spigot and Github. Though, feel free to download and test my Plugins! Even if it isn't intended for public use

# Requirements🔥

1. Java 17 ☕
2. Minecraft 1.18.1👀

# Installation🕹️

1. Create A Server
   
   1. Download [Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/get/bf7ac3b5bc08ea97d22919680d240a80)
   
   2. Make a new folder
   
   3. Paste and rename the Spigot file to `spigot.jar`
   
   4. Make a new text file and paste in
      
      `@echo off java -Xms3G -Xmx3G -jar spigot.jar -nogui pause`
   
   5. Save as start.bat and open it
   
   6. Open the newly created file `eula.txt` and change eula to **true**
   
   7. Run start.bat again

2. Download the .jar file

# Basic Premise🪄

You can message people in your server privately!

- Message anyone who is online

- Reply to the messages (only once though)

It's simple, but still does the job

# Usage💡

Write `/message help` for in-game help

`/message <player> <message>` is the overall Syntax for messaging 

(btw you don't need to write the '<>' symbols I added them just for clarity)

`/repy <message>` is how you reply to a message! The Plugin is a smart boi and knows whether or not you have gotten a message from the player you want to reply to

# Acknowledgements🏆

This project is actually a challenge from [This Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/) on Udemy made by Stephen King, all credit for the initial idea goes to him, although I didn't look at the code he wrote and all the code that's located inside this plugin is my original code (except the `ColorCode.translate()` I yoinked that, sorry :P)
